They also had a really unique desert - soju infused bingsu which you have to try! Overall this is a great place to bring friends for a casual meal with a great atmosphere and amazing service.

We were one of the few people there tho so I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs like if the place is busy. Loved the makgeolli drinks they had. One downside is the blender. It was the loudest blender we‚Äôve ever heard of and it could easily disrupt any conversation you have if you sit near the bar.

While it is a bar/restaurant, I primarily went for the delicious food. During my recent visit, my partner and I ordered three dishes: Spicy Chicken Fried Rice, Spicy Squid & Pork Belly, and the Marinated Pork Feet. The Fried Rice was a delightful Korean classic that I highly recommend. Adding cheese for an extra $2 balances out the spice from the Kimchi and provides a nice kick and acidic flavor (would highly recommend). The perfectly cooked egg on top also adds a really nice richness to the dish, cutting it open and letting the yolk ooze made me immediately hungry. One thing I will say though, it was really difficult to find the chicken in this dish, perhaps it blended in, or they didn‚Äôt give a lot, but either way it was soooo good. The Spicy Squid & Pork Belly dish is perfect for those who enjoy heavy flavors. It offers a blend of garlic, onion, spiciness, and sweetness, complemented by a slight char from the hot plate. While there wasn't a lot of squid, the ample amount of Pork Belly made up for it. My favorite way to enjoy this was by placing it on top of a spoonful of fried rice for a timeless combo of rice and meat. Lastly, the pork feet, a dish worth trying even if you're not familiar with Asian foods. The texture is soft, reminiscent of the fatty part of bacon, with no distinct ""feet"" flavor but rather the taste of the marinated meat. Dipped in the provided ssamjang (sweet and salty fermented soybean sauce) and wrapped in lettuce, it becomes a delightful burst of fat, sweet, salty, and spicy flavors. Personally, I slightly prefer their Cold Pork Feet, as I enjoy the chewier and springier texture of the cold meat over the ""melt in your mouth"" feel of the warm meat. Overall, Bangia stands as a solid Korean restaurant, offering a great alternative to other places in K-town where waiting 1-2 hours is common. While the dishes average around $30 each, the generous portion sizes make it worth the money. I find that lots of places in K-town will cost about ~$30 an entree, but you don‚Äôt get a lot of food."

We got the bibimbap, galbi jim with bibim naengmyeon combo, and a bottle of soju. The bibimbap was fresh, classic, and a vote of confidence for how the rest of the food was going to taste. The galbi boiled in a sauce to reduce as we ate, and got more and more tender in the pot. The flavor was excellent, especially with some charred onions and peppers reducing in there too. The naengmyeon was also perfect, such traditional flavors coming through. The banchan was also some of the best I‚Äôve had, with a delicious fresh scallion pancake repeatedly being replenished.

There was no long waiting line, but the restaurant looked fully seated when we came in. The waiters are friendly and food service is relatively fast. The lighting is a bit dark (all my food pictures were taken with flash on). Music was a bit loud but we could still carry a conversation. As for the food - great for the price, especially for this location. Every dish is about $30 but large enough for sharing - we ordered 3 main dishes to share among 4 people: marinated pork feet, corn cheese pancake and spicy squid and pork belly. The marinated pork feet is nicely flavored and has a nice tender to it. I wish we had more lettuce to wrap with the meat, but it only came with 4 big leaves. The meat does get cold pretty quickly as it is serve on a wooden board. The corn cheese pancake is basically cheesy extra soft bread. The corn flavor is a bit weak, as well as the cheese flavor. It might be good for those who like light dishes and don't want something too cheesy. The spicy squid and pork belly is sweet and delicious. It goes really well with rice. Good amount of meat as well as vegetables. Highly recommend this dish! Overall really good experience! I would certainly come back here again and bring a group of friends so we can share and try out more dishes!"

They gave the table a free seaweed with clam soup for the table to start. We ordered chicken wings (2 flavors) and then the army stew. Both were delicious but I wouldn't say it was exceptional.

The food wasn't the best; the wings were dry and the fried rice was one of the saltiest things I've ever tasted. The service, as well, wasn't the best. We had to wait almost 10 minutes at the hostess stand (this was after opening time) before someone would come and seat us. Even after we were seated, we still had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to get water. We thought this was a bit strange considering we were the only party there at the time. However, the real problem occurred after we left the restaurant. I paid for the bill using my card and the total (after writing in tip) came out to $69 for three people. A few days later, upon logging into my banking app, I was shocked to see that Bangia had charged me $971.88 for the meal, $902.88 MORE than the $69 total that I had indicated on the receipt. I always make an effort to make the tip and total very clear when filling out the receipts: the ""cent"" numbers are always written smaller and underlined, so there should be no room for confusion, let alone room for an extra $902.88 charge. That evening we contacted the restaurant and spoke with the manager, who said that he knew that he had made a mistake, but was ""waiting for us to contact him"", before fixing his mistake and issuing a refund. What if I never noticed, and as a result, never contacted him? Was he planning on just keeping the extra $900, even if he KNEW that a mistake had occurred? Interestingly, a quick search (there's another review here on Yelp) shows that other customers ALSO had issues with being charged extra tip. Hmm. I don't recommend this restaurant at all-- there's no point in risking an extra $900 charge on your card to eat mediocre food and receive mediocre service. There are a ton of better options in Koreatown."

It didn't seem to look like a restaurant when I first walked in. I saw a full bar but realized after that they served food and had tables in the back. I ordered the fried chicken and cold draft beers. Now I've had tons of fried chicken before in this neighborhood from Kyochon, Bonchon, WA Bar and even Mad For Chicken, but Bangia brings originality with their chicken without being too greasy, very crispy, crunchy and It's not overly flavored which bring out the natural flavors of the chicken. The fried chicken was super light and the beers were ice cold. Service was on point but then again they had those buttons at the table which you can abuse for service. If you want a chicken and beer night, check out this new spot!"

We got the budaejigae and a spicy pork dish which weren't very good or authentic in my opinion.

We noticed that we were next on the list to be seated at these seats and that the bartender was clearing/cleaning them for us. They cleared the spots then in walked a couple that clearly knew the host (they did not have their name on the list). Rather than respecting our name on the list/the time we spent waiting, the host sat the couple that just walked in. When I attempted to ask why- the host only shrugged and apologized. We left and found better options for the soju we were looking for at other bars in the area that respected our time and had a better grasp of customer service. Recommend going elsewhere if theyre too busy to seat you- save your time for a place that will serve you/respect your wait time. EDIT: as requested by the owner in their response. I arrived approximately 8:26 PM (sent a confirmation text to my friend) and left at 8:54 PM (sent a text to a different group that we could meet up earlier than expected). The issue was not the wait time- it was a Friday night, we expected a wait. The issue was that there was only a party of 4 ahead of us on the list at the time, and they were hoping to get a table to eat. 2 spots opened at the bar, we had been waiting the longest (other than the party of 4) and yet the bar spots were given to two people that walked in when we were told they were being cleared for us."

But better than the ingredients they cook the rice cakes so it's SOFT and not too chewy like other places I've tried. Also give their fried chicken a try!
