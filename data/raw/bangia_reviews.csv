1,5,This is great lowkey spot in Ktown. They have a great menu and the drink options are super affordable. They also had a really unique desert - soju infused bingsu which you have to try! Overall this is a great place to bring friends for a casual meal with a great atmosphere and amazing service.
2,5,The food was flavorful and the vibes was nice for a hangout with friends. We were one of the few people there tho so I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs like if the place is busy. Loved the makgeolli drinks they had. One downside is the blender. It was the loudest blender we‚Äôve ever heard of and it could easily disrupt any conversation you have if you sit near the bar.
3,5,Discovered Manhattan‚Äôs first soju smoothie with my husband! This place got this ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna leave here drunk‚Äù vibe with incredible hospitality and atmosphere. They got a fabulous blood sausage with rice cake and don‚Äôt forget their daily drink specials. Definitely a terrific experience luring you to come back.ü•≥
4,5,"As a Korean girl, I only came here because my friends wanted to come here. I usually don‚Äôt go to Korean places, but this place was actually pretty good! The tteokbuki was cooked right and they even gave us an extra one as service. In fact, they gave us like 2 rounds worth of drinks for 8 ppl as service! They had such a great time! Shout out to John for being so great! Thanks!"
5,5,The alcoholic bingsoo a were great. Our favorite was the mango. We also ordered the soondae and tteokbokki were spicy and delicious. It was more than enough for a late night snack for 3 people. The atmosphere was great and the staff treated us very well even when we stayed past closing time. Will be back again.
6,5,"If you're craving good Korean food without enduring absurdly long lines, Bangia is the ideal place to visit. While it is a bar/restaurant, I primarily went for the delicious food. During my recent visit, my partner and I ordered three dishes: Spicy Chicken Fried Rice, Spicy Squid & Pork Belly, and the Marinated Pork Feet. The Fried Rice was a delightful Korean classic that I highly recommend. Adding cheese for an extra $2 balances out the spice from the Kimchi and provides a nice kick and acidic flavor (would highly recommend). The perfectly cooked egg on top also adds a really nice richness to the dish, cutting it open and letting the yolk ooze made me immediately hungry. One thing I will say though, it was really difficult to find the chicken in this dish, perhaps it blended in, or they didn‚Äôt give a lot, but either way it was soooo good. The Spicy Squid & Pork Belly dish is perfect for those who enjoy heavy flavors. It offers a blend of garlic, onion, spiciness, and sweetness, complemented by a slight char from the hot plate. While there wasn't a lot of squid, the ample amount of Pork Belly made up for it. My favorite way to enjoy this was by placing it on top of a spoonful of fried rice for a timeless combo of rice and meat. Lastly, the pork feet, a dish worth trying even if you're not familiar with Asian foods. The texture is soft, reminiscent of the fatty part of bacon, with no distinct ""feet"" flavor but rather the taste of the marinated meat. Dipped in the provided ssamjang (sweet and salty fermented soybean sauce) and wrapped in lettuce, it becomes a delightful burst of fat, sweet, salty, and spicy flavors. Personally, I slightly prefer their Cold Pork Feet, as I enjoy the chewier and springier texture of the cold meat over the ""melt in your mouth"" feel of the warm meat. Overall, Bangia stands as a solid Korean restaurant, offering a great alternative to other places in K-town where waiting 1-2 hours is common. While the dishes average around $30 each, the generous portion sizes make it worth the money. I find that lots of places in K-town will cost about ~$30 an entree, but you don‚Äôt get a lot of food."
7,5,"Great gastropub type Korean spot out of the limelight of KTown‚Äôs Main Street. We got the bibimbap, galbi jim with bibim naengmyeon combo, and a bottle of soju. The bibimbap was fresh, classic, and a vote of confidence for how the rest of the food was going to taste. The galbi boiled in a sauce to reduce as we ate, and got more and more tender in the pot. The flavor was excellent, especially with some charred onions and peppers reducing in there too. The naengmyeon was also perfect, such traditional flavors coming through. The banchan was also some of the best I‚Äôve had, with a delicious fresh scallion pancake repeatedly being replenished. Would definitely come back!"
8,3,"Very cozy and the service is great, I was a little disappointed in the food though"
9,5,"Bangia is the ONLY restaurant in NYC serving alcoholic shaved ice drinks. You can choose between soju or makgeolli bingsul or their bingmac (binsul somaek), all of which are delicious. But not only are their drinks good, you‚Äôll be blown away by their food options as well. Our group unanimously agreed that our favorite dish of the night were the tofu with kimchi and pork and the truffle oil potato pancake. But there wasn‚Äôt a single dish we disliked!"
10,5,"We arrived 15 minutes after they opened and did not expect it to be so busy already! We didn't have a reservation, so we waited around 30 minutes. A big party canceled, so we got that table so it was spacious for a party of just two. I was surprised with the quality, and the portion is huge for the price! Other restaurants that sell the same price have way smaller portions. The makgeolli drinks were delicious!! It was so good. I had the makgeolli bingsu, and my fiance ordered the makgeolli cocktail, and they tasted so good! The food was also very yummy!!! I wish I had known about this restaurant earlier! Definitely coming back for more drinks!! and try the other foods. Also, I was surprised the seafood stew came with so much seafood and even crab!"
11,3,We ordered a lot of food and shared everything and it was all in generously portioned and delicious. Our group was seated in a separate alcove and it was the perfect level of loud fun ambiance while still being able to have conversations. But the service is kinda negligence.
12,4,"A hidden (literally in the basement) gem just on the outer edge of K-Town. There was no long waiting line, but the restaurant looked fully seated when we came in. The waiters are friendly and food service is relatively fast. The lighting is a bit dark (all my food pictures were taken with flash on). Music was a bit loud but we could still carry a conversation. As for the food - great for the price, especially for this location. Every dish is about $30 but large enough for sharing - we ordered 3 main dishes to share among 4 people: marinated pork feet, corn cheese pancake and spicy squid and pork belly. The marinated pork feet is nicely flavored and has a nice tender to it. I wish we had more lettuce to wrap with the meat, but it only came with 4 big leaves. The meat does get cold pretty quickly as it is serve on a wooden board. The corn cheese pancake is basically cheesy extra soft bread. The corn flavor is a bit weak, as well as the cheese flavor. It might be good for those who like light dishes and don't want something too cheesy. The spicy squid and pork belly is sweet and delicious. It goes really well with rice. Good amount of meat as well as vegetables. Highly recommend this dish! Overall really good experience! I would certainly come back here again and bring a group of friends so we can share and try out more dishes!"
13,5,"Very nicely decorated! We did have a wait for a table of 2 on a Wednesday night. The food was BOMB. Bangia Bingsu‚Äî one of their cocktails. It‚Äôs a MUST TRY. It was essentially a soju snowcone with fresh fruit and a touch of sweetness. It was fantastic experience too. The spoon literally looks like a snow shovel. The army stew reminded us of Korea! All great, would go again!"
14,4,"The food was really tasty and authentic, and it's an extensive menu to choose from. We noticed the prices were kind of high - mostly over $30/dish - so we thought to only get 3 dishes for 4 people because we assumed the portions were huge. But they were a normal size, and just overpriced. Maybe it's that expensive because there's a 10% discount when you pay with cash, so it's more like $25-$30/dish, but it's still a bit pricey imo. We ended up getting more food somewhere else since a fourth dish would've been too much. The decorations inside were really nice though dim, but there was a doorbell that rings SO LOUDLY every couple minutes, which is just weird."
15,4,"I made a reservation online and their automated system will spam you to remind you of your reservation. There's a 10% discount when you pay in cash. I arrived 10 min early and was able to be seated without my full party. I love the d√©cor. Hooks for belongings along the walls and QR codes to view the menu. What stood out to me was the exceptional staff here; masked, polite, and multiple waiters for all the tables rather than just 1. They gave the table a free seaweed with clam soup for the table to start. We ordered chicken wings (2 flavors) and then the army stew. Both were delicious but I wouldn't say it was exceptional. Since we dined in on a Tuesday, their daily special was $9.99 for their signature cocktails (compared to the usual $16.25!). I liked how I didn't feel rushed out when we were done. Really recommend!"
16,4,"came here for dinner, made a resy for a weekday for 4 people. was seated quickly, got army stew, bulgogi rice platter and seafood pancake. i would say that it‚Äôs pretty expensive here, the pancake was like $25 when it‚Äôs around $10-15 everywhere else in ktown. not sure i‚Äôll come back here again."
17,1,"I don‚Äôt understand the hype about this place. we ordered the soy garlic and the spicy wings, both were bland. The soy garlic had no taste and the spicy ones tasted like ketchup. The cheesy corn pancake was just ok. Also tried some dumplings and they‚Äôre deep fried - probably previously frozen. :( the only thing i didn‚Äôt mind was the complimentary egg in the stone bowl üòÖ"
18,5,"Went with a group of friends around 10PM, we had to wait 1 hour to get a table, but we already expected that it would be crowded. I drank some soju with lychee that was really sweet (the way I like) and we ordered the fried chicken (super delicious) and a budaejjigae (the best stew you can eat in cold weather and in a group)"
19,3,5/5 service & atmosphere - great to drink with friends and awesome service. Food sucks? The intestine was stale. Army soup was bland. Fried rice also stale. Idk maybe when you‚Äôre drunk it tastes good but I was sober and food was no bueno.
20,5,"The food at Bangia was bangin! We kicked off the night with the lychee soju for the table and really liked how it came with a side of lychees. We also ordered the seafood pancake and it was delicious, on par with other restaurants around the area. Also liked the pork belly as it had a nice crisp to its edges. The highlight of our night was probably the cheesy dokbokki. This is my first time having a cheesy version of it and it was incredible! Lots of cheese!"
21,4,"Food was very tasty and I liked their outdoor set up for dining during the pandemic. It was around 48¬∞ and we were quite comfortable eating in their heated hut, plenty of air flowing through. We enjoyed all of our dishes and the cold chamisul (soju). There was one waiter serving all of the outdoor tables, he tried hard but was a little overwhelmed."
22,5,The food is delicious!! One of the best korean restaurants I have been to. It's good for a social gathering but not ideal of date night because it gets very busy and loud.
23,5,"Food: 5/5. Large portions, all served hot and fresh. Particularly recommend the Chapaguri and the tteokbokki. Service: 4/5 really curt service at the door that gave us some grief for having international IDs and vaccine information but ultimately let us in. Atmosphere: 4.5/5 unexpectedly spacious interior with nice decor. The only problem was the very loud music"
24,5,"This place is wonderful, I love it , the food and the drinks are so great, Love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
25,4,"Waiters are pushy. And the main manager yells at his waiters frequently. Food was good, typical korean bar affair. Bottles were pushed quickly out to us as needed. If your not sitting in the main area, your pretty blocked off from the main atmosphere."
26,5,"When people think of K-Town, they usually think of Korean BBQ and Soondubu. This place is a nice change of pace from all that. Very good Tteokboki, budae jigae, and Korean Fried Chicken. That watermelon punch was üî•. So so good. ‚Ä¶"
27,5,"Everything was very delicious, the shaved ice alcohol drink was something else, amazing! Great to go with a large group, I feel like the value for money here is great!"
28,5,"A great place to spend your New Year‚Äôs Eve! They have good food, drinks, decorations, celebrations and service with a very reasonable price:) would totally recommend! Bring cash for 10% off!"
29,5,Food was so yum and the service was excellent. I‚Äôve tried almost everything and it never disappoints and always satisfies me. Love this place!
30,4,Always like this marinated pork feet! Drinks are good too.
31,4,"the soup tastes great, but the meat inside are all processed food like spam and sausage. The port feet are fine, it will taste better if it were hot. The waiters are very nice and patient."
32,5,Amazing everything! Perfect spot for a date and drink! Also great for hangover foods. Had an amazing squid and meat! The servers are also very nice and witty. Recommended!
33,5,Great place. With affordable price for it location in Manhattan. The dishes are large portions that are meant to be shared among a group. Also if you pay in cash you get a 10% discount on the bill.
34,5,"First and foremost, this is one of the few places that are still serving after midnight. However, their service and food are also great. The serving of pig feet was very generous and the spicy pork with squid had fantastic flavor."
35,5,Great time for late night in Korean town food lots flavor and drinks are good. Service was good and staff very fun and outgoing. Overall great time
36,3,"3.25.19 - came for dinner; family friendly and really nice and attentive staff; the hog trotter is spot on; everything else, seafood pancake, grilled mackerel, wings, and the rice were all good, but nothing too special. Note, the mackerel is dry, so you really need the sauce; the wings in plain form is slightly dry, too. The decor is interesting, dark tones, and masculine. Clubby music, consistent crowd with fast turnover. I think the bar area seems like a good spot to post up, but I assume it can get a little tight. I'd go back for the trotter and pancakes, but all else is normal K-Town fare. 3 stars only because its ultimately base level, and not a knock on anything else. The best part is probably the service."
37,2,"The atmosphere reminded me of Korea, and so much of the beginning experience filled me with nostalgia‚ÄîI loved that the (original) makgeolli was served in a kettle with metal bowls, the seaweed soup that was given ‚Äòon the house‚Äô, and the buttons to call the server over. I had high hopes for the food‚Äîbut the food was not great, especially at the price point. We got the beef brisket ddukbokki‚Äîthe rice cakes were overcooked and the flavor was underwhelming. I love both spicy and soy sauce-based ddukbokki, but this one was a total miss, almost inedible. The jokbal (pig trotters) was cooked well, but it seemed to have been marinated with a lot of aromatics (more than what I prefer). It is not served with saeoojeot (fermented tiny shrimp), which was unfortunate, but I liked having it as ssam (wrapped in lettuce). Towards the end of our meal, there was some confusion‚Äîa staff member asked us to move to a smaller table to make room for a larger group. Almost as soon as we did so, another staff member was trying to seat a new couple at the smaller table we had moved to, so we were awkwardly with our unfinished makgeolli and coats/bags in our hands as the new couple was waiting for us, and we hadn‚Äôt even gotten the chance to take out our wallets to pay the bill. It seems to have just been poor communication going on, but it left a bad impression, and what was supposed to be a celebratory dinner ended up as a ‚Äúnever again.‚Äù"
38,4,"Our experience at Bangia was exceptional. The welcoming and efficient service provided by the staff was impeccable. We were thoroughly impressed with the flavor-packed kimchi fried rice and juicy grilled pork belly, though the portion size could have been more generous. We were pleasantly surprised with complimentary steamed egg and cheesy corn pancake, both of which were delectable. The cheesy seafood toekkbokki was a standout dish, perfectly balanced and delicious.The lively and joyful ambiance of Bangia added to the overall experience."
39,5,Omg the food here is super delicious and legit. The army stew was so yummy and great to share with others. Their lychee cocktail was perfect and not too sweet. It comes in a container with a light inside which made it look cool to take pictures with.
40,1,"Worst experience at this place! My husband and I checked in, waited about 10 min, got a text that our table was ready and waited an additional 10 min so they can clean our table‚Ä¶ After getting seated, my husband and I are looking at the menu, realized 15 min passed and we still haven‚Äôt gotten helped. A table that sat after us got their orders taken before us. We waited an additional 5 min to see if anyone would help and still nothing! We walked out, the hostess and waiter saw us leave and didn‚Äôt say a word! I have a feeling they‚Äôre racist! My husband and I were the only ones in the restaurant of COLOR. My husband is black and I am Hispanic. Never again. If you are of color please do not go here. This place was recommended by someone working at our hotel, I will let him know about our experience and tell him not to recommend this place, especially if you‚Äôre black or Hispanic."
41,5,"This is one of my go-to places in ktown! While it's off the main ktown block, I consider that a plus as you can just walk in on a Friday night and get a seat. The servers are really friendly and patient. The food and drinks are also fantastic. They have really good pork belly!"
42,5,"Such a fun place, and the food was great."
43,5,Very cute interior and even better shaved ice! The lychee and mango shaved ice with soju were very good and I will definitely be back!
44,1,Finished a shift from work and was gonna check out what the homies next door on my right have but we have some grown dude verbally yelling at one of their staff while the other one was sitting there. Girlie if you see this you deserve better than some old loser yelling in your face like that. I can get you a better job. Just go next door and ask for my name and leave ur info
45,4,"Food came out quickly, portions were large and tasty. The menu is online via a qr code and inside dining was reservation only. The outside dining was clean, warm and divided each table with plexiglass."
46,5,"A Korean friend brought me and my partner here for drinks and food. Everything was great, and service was phenomenal. We were there early on a Wednesday (6:15) got a table to problem (they sat us before our whole party was there, as they had just opened). Kimchi pancake was great. Portions are HUGE! definitely meant for sharing!"
47,2,"Service was a bit disappointing. My friends and I are not Koreans and we didn‚Äôt feel very welcome. I also got yelled at when making the line at the bathroom. I originally thought it was just a random event and didn‚Äôt want to post my review, but checking the other reviews it seems people have complained about the same issues."
48,4,Different than other Korean restaurants which i have been. But is good. It a bar and restaurant in the basement. And the location is hard to find. But the food and service is good.
49,4,"Food and drinks here were great, the service is friendly and items came out fast. It helps coming with someone who speaks Korean!"
50,5,We ordered octopus and pork stir fry and army stew. The food was amazing and maaaaaasive. Easily feed 3 of us. Definitely we come back to try others!
51,5,One of the waiters recommended a really tasty dish and the drinks were also delicious.
52,4,"Good food, service, and got a shot for my bday so that made me very happy :)"
53,5,We randomly walked into this place for some small bites and drinks and it was the best hidden gem we‚Äôve been to. The food was exceptional and the entire vibe of the place was great. We will definitely be going back again.
54,3,"Solid Korean spot on 32nd and 5th, good food, pretty restaurant, nice atmosphere and environment, reasonably priced. The noodles were really tasty üòã Need some work on the chicken though, quite overcooked/overfried ‚Ä¶"
55,1,"One star for take out Teokbokki. I ordered the pork and kimchi teokbokki and it came with no sauce, just a puddle of oil from the grilled pork. I had to pour the oil out because there was so much pooling at the bottom of my dish. If you are in the area and want a teokbokki dish, I would not recommend the pork and kimchi one here."
56,1,"Food is good, but all the servers have serious attitude problem...we got yelled at when we were simply waiting in line for bathroom"
57,2,"Overly crowded and loud. Mediocre food, blandly flavored. No staple Korean side dishes."
58,5,My favorite authentic K-town late night bar. The egg thing w the pepperoni and the grilled mackerel are so dope. Buddae jiggae Is a must ! Staff is authentic efficient and kind. We pretty much always get the same thing. Cool vibes too.
59,4,The place is kinda dark. It‚Äôs located on basement. The service is slow. The portions are big.
60,4,Very much like late night eateries in Seoul. Great low key no fuss vibes with solid options where you can keep the night going or end it with authentic Korean drinks and food. Loved it. On my list as one of my spots now.
61,4,Pretty cool spot with interesting ornaments (see: big giraffe) and the ambiance was bar-like but with more seating. Music selection was great. Signature Drinks were supposed to be 9.99 but we got charged 15 for the Bangia Bingsul. Guess it wasn't part of the signature drinks deal? One warning about the food is the corn cheese pancake. It was mediocre (think microwave pizza) and definitely not worth $35.49.
62,5,"The ddeokbokki is to die for, GREAT selection of sojus, and awesome staff. We came for dinner, and ended up coming back about an hour later (after running errands) to sit at the bar and try out more of the sojus. This place is a staple for me when I'm in the city!"
63,1,Noisy. Bad food. Meh service. Expensive. Perfect New York City combo
64,5,The setting is cute and dark. The staff is very helpful when it comes to understanding somethings on the menu. The food is delicious! They were very nice in bringing out a cake my friends brought from outside for my birthday!
65,5,This place was awesome yummy food good vibe nice service absolutely we will back.
66,4,Good anju (drinking food) and fun atmosphere to go with friends. Prices are reasonable for ktown and portions are made for sharing. Fun interior and attentive servers.
67,5,"This is such a cozy bar! The food is a mighty portion for one person, but still tasty. Make sure to grab a bottle of soju if you stop by."
68,1,"Entered the restaurant with my fianc√©. I‚Äôm Korean and my fianc√© is Latino. Host asks how many, in English, and I tell him 2. He tells me there‚Äôs a 30 minute wait, which we agree to and accept. Literally 5 seconds later a group of 4 walk in. He asks them, in English, how many people then notice the whole party is Korean so starts speaking Korean. They tell him 4, in Korean, and he tells them he has two small tables that he can combine for them. I hear this, because I am standing right there. And I am fluent in Korean, so I look at the host, and we walk out. And that, my friends, is how u get a 1 star. By discriminating. I didn‚Äôt even want to tell him I understood Korean because that definitely pissed me off."
69,5,"The food was delicious, came quickly, and the employees were kind. The environment is super cute, they try harder to create a cool experience than 90% of NYC bars. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Really fun spot."
70,5,This place was great! My friend and I had an awesome meal and the staff was very friendly. I wish we were able to drink that day because it would have only added to the experience. Will definitely go again!
71,1,"This place is horrifying. The food was in very poor condition and the overall quality of sanitation was terrible. The kimchi was fermenting in a big trashcan and was placed in the hallway where people dine. The strawberries in the cocktail had mold on them and the place was reeking with a disturbing odor. The working environment for the waitor seemed very concerning as well. The person who I assume to be the manager was shouting and throwing cups at a coworker. This happened in front of all the customers, which was very disturbing. I‚Äôm writing this review for the sake of all potential customers so that they won‚Äôt have to go through this traumatizing experience."
72,5,"most delicious tteokbokki i've ever had, tasty cocktails, awesome ambiance. will definitely come back here next time i visit NYC."
73,4,"Not a bad place for drinks and food. I prefer the truffle noodles and beef stew, army stew, spicy stew and wings. I like the texture and ingredients for the seafood pancake but the taste is a little bit different. Maybe cause the sauce is more bland."
74,1,"The place is overrated. Used to be good but now the food quality has gone down and filled with rude staff. Each dish is around $27 and it‚Äôs super small sized. The staff all have huge egos. Ordering you around. Also had an extremely unpleasant experience as we were leaving. A guy came up to our party and said ‚ÄúWe have a long wait, please help yourself out‚Äù within 5 min of us getting the check. Avoid this place at all cost."
75,5,My all time favorite bar. They always welcome ppl. Love love their vibes. They try their best to develop new drinks and food menu seasonally. You never get bored with them.
76,3,"Decor - could do with an update everything seemed a little dilapidated and the bright lights strewn about restaurant refocused the attention away from these issues. Service - was mediocre at best a lack of attentive staff who just seemed to want to get you in and out and slap a plate of food in-front of you didn‚Äôt seem too welcoming and friendly. Food - here is where it gets better the beef bulgogi was great sweet, savory and rich pairs well with the rice. The stews we ordered were good in flavor. But I have say keeping skin on the chicken was a no no as it was dimpled and severely chewy yuk! Price - reasonable considering Korean tends to run on the pricey side compared to most other cuisines. Won‚Äôt be running back to this place but it was ‚Äòdecent‚Äô hence the 3 stars."
77,5,"We read on the reviews that it had the best Tteokbokki ever, and it lived up to it, the food in general is delicious, the drinks are also amazing, I had a strawberry bingsul that was surprisingly DELICIOUS! Service is ALSO great, the staff was really nice and mindful! I'm so coming back more times!"
78,5,Always a good experience here. The waiters are super friendly and the food is good. Everything is pretty large so share between friends and get containers if you can't finish.
79,5,"Delicious korean food. Make sure to make a reservation if going around dinner time on weekends, otherwise I have experienced one hour + waits. Get the corn cheese pancake!!!"
80,3,"Overpriced street food. I got their most popular dish: Army Soup, and I regretted it after. The warm cheesy hot dog juice with tofu that cost $45 has gave me a stomach ache. If you do end up here, order family style."
81,5,Good food & drinks! Great shooters & lychee bingsoo. Busy
82,5,"Went there with our Finance Team to celebrate the end of a good year for the company. Loads of food, which was delicious. Took home the two pork dishes for leftovers. One was the fish cake soup and the other was the marinated beef rice platter. The servings were so plentiful and the seasoning was so delicious! We also had spicy squid, spicy french fries (don't eat more than one at a time unless you're game to take the heat). Also loved the Army Stew and the story behind it. Let's talk about the drinks. We had Lychee martinis that were fabulous. They might have been a little sweet at first, but the alcohol sneaks up on you. Wait staff was very attentive and pleasant. Atmosphere was fine because they had screens playing current music from BTS and other contemporary groups. Would love to go again."
83,4,"Place is great, bar upfront, really cool atmosphere and great service and really good food, definitely planning on going again"
84,5,Traditional korean food/big portion/good location/fun place to drink!
85,5,"Fun vibe, tasty menu. The squid and pork belly, and the yuzu unfiltered soju, were standouts."
86,4,Foods are great - we loved the army stew! The servers are super friendly and patient. We reserved our place on a Saturday night and went early. The place didn't open until 5:30 pm. despite slots being shown as available before that in their online reservation system( I remembered). So just make sure to double-check.
87,4,"Not typical Korean restaurant, meaning you can order food not that spicy. Remember bringing your ID if you want to drink alcohol."
88,5,This is a nice hidden bar/restaurant in KTown that rarely has a wait and has great cheap food.
89,5,"Kinda a hidden spot (it's a basement), but a perfect place for bar food/Korean snacks."
90,3,"The food is okay, the lychee smoothie is very good. Highly recommended. There servers is indeed very handsome, but I hope next time not only show up order food and check out."
91,4,"The army pot was objectively good, but since it‚Äôs a common dish, I think it felt sloppy for some reason & not as good as other places. Other dishes where unique and delicious."
92,5,Good portions for the price. Very tasty! I recommended the lychee soju cocktail‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° it's my new fave. Sorry for the crummy pictures lolol
93,4,"Very friendly staff, big portions of yummy food at reasonable prices !!"
94,5,"Absolutely the best Korean food I‚Äôve ever had in my life. From the food to the service, to the ambiance, everything was a 10/10. Most of our party were new to Korean cuisine and our server was happy to lead us through the menu, making sure we had everything we needed to fully experience Bangia. We even had a member of our party with food sensitivities and the staff were so caring and accommodating that I‚Äôll recommend this place to anyone all day every day. Thank you guys for one of the coolest dining experiences ever. I‚Äôm gonna be dreaming about that pork kimchi stew and army stew for the rest of the year. I‚Äôll definitely be back one day!"
95,5,"Prior to the pandemic, my friends and I would stop in for drinks after work. They have a small bar but good Korean side dishes and large menu. I haven't been for a full meal but seemed popular the host kept checking in people every few minutes while we were there."
96,1,"Be aware that they served Soju with the lid opened. I visited here with my coworker a year ago at around 7 pm. (The reason I'm trying to leave this review now. I don't want other ppl to experience this like me.) On that day, We ordered popular foods and a bottle of Soju. a Korean tall young man served the Soju and food. He literally serves Soju with the lid opened. (I've never seen this in my whole life ) I tasted Soju and it taste like soju mixed with water. I was too shocked to claim it to the man and also too busy to talk with my coworker. and just ignored it. and now I'm writing this review because I've never been there again and this terrible memory still stays in my head. but I love their food tho."
97,1,"Worst place in ktown for sure. Used to be decent years ago. Overpriced food that's probably all microwaved (>$30), terrible service. Waiter/host was hanging out outside swinging a golf club with a friend while people were waiting to order. Literally go anywhere else"
98,5,Great food and fast service. Found on Yelp. Nice atmosphere too would definitely recommend and return the next time I visit.
99,5,Great late night wings and frozen soju with fun vibe.
100,5,Incredible food and service. Everything was really tasty and food was ready really quick.
101,5,"I love Bangia, and I guarantee that you will too. I‚Äôm literally here all the time. Food is great, service is great and I‚Äôve never felt uncomfortable eating here which can sometimes be an experience for black people in Ktown. Love them and I recommend them to people all the time."
102,2,"Food is fine, but the service is poor. We kept waiting for 40mins until I asked why we couldn't sit on the empty seats at the bar (they were always empty since we arrived). They told us that's because we didn't want to sit at the bar, but we never said so! After seated, we waited another 10min before we realized we needed to scan to get the menu. No one introduced that to us."
103,5,The food was good but honestly Seunghyuk was the top tier service that every food service industry staff should learn from. He made me and my friends entire night.
104,5,"One of the best pocha in ktown. The staff here are friendly and welcoming. Food and drinks are amazing and delicious. We spent most of our weekend night in here. You must try the cheese and chicken feet, and chicken gizzards. Tastes great."
105,4,"Great happy hour! $10 for their signature cocktails and $7 for sangria. Got busy after 7pm, but we got a table in 15 mins. Food is pretty good. The cheese corn pancake was huge and loaded with cheese if you like that. It filled me up pretty quickly after one slice. Great place to hang out with friends and share food."
106,5,"Food in a very good portion. If you look for a korean mood meal, this is the right place. ;)"
107,4,Good spot for an afterwork diner. I like the laidback atmosphere.
108,5,I love this place!! My boyfriend and I normally stop here before / after dinner reservations to pass time and it's always a good time here. The small plates are really good too! The drinks are delish and the ambiance is always fun :)
109,5,Many food and drink options. Pretty decor and good music. Big portions. We were greeted promptly at the counter and the waiters/waitresses were super nice and patient. 10% off if you pay with cash. Overall had a fun pleasant time with friends. One of the better korean restaurant/bar near ktown. Will be back!
110,5,My favorite Korean restaurant in ktown! They serve big family style dishes for sharing. Their cocktails are also really yummy.
111,2,"Food was good but the host guy at reception was extremely rude and condescending. We made a reservation for 6:45 and arrived at 6:50 which was within Bangia‚Äôs grace period (10 min, so by 6:55). The host didn‚Äôt even greet us, the first thing he said was ‚Äúyou are late!‚Äù When we explained our reservation was for 6:45 he then said the table was ready at 6:32 and accused me of not responding to his text messages. But our reservation was at 6:45. How am I supposed to arrive before my reserved slot just because the table was ready a few minutes earlier? When I showed him the text messages where I did also reply 1 to confirm my reservation he kept giving us attitude and lecturing us, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be late next time ok?‚Äù It was very unprofessional and patronizing Also there was not line and 4-5 empty tables when we arrived. What‚Äôs the point of badgering your customers when they made a reservation, arrived on time for the reservation, and there were many empty tables?? Extremely disappointed. No one should be treated like this. Wouldn‚Äôt come back. Wanted to be clear this review is specifically for the HOST guy at RECEPTION, NOT the servers who helped our table. Servers were good. It‚Äôs the host who was rude and condescending."
112,4,Personally I don't really like spicy food. My friends love it. The seafood pancake is good. They have the best fried chicken compare to other Korean fried chicken places.
113,5,"You‚Äôve just finished up a three rounds of pool down the street and six times as many tequila shots. Before that you were pregaming in an East Village apartment and it started at 6pm on a Friday. You‚Äôre seeing double. You‚Äôve got a 10am Soul Cycle class tomorrow. BANGIA will get you there on time and sober. Get the army stew - personally I say leave the cheese out because it gives the soup a nasty taste- and let the electrolytes, carbs, and proteins go to work. It‚Äôs big enough for four people so bring your friends. The food is priced for a group. Enjoy. And to the people complaining about the service - reality check: we waited 5 minutes on a Friday night."
114,5,"delicious food overall! army stew is fab!! spicy pork stir fry was a hit and lychee soju is a must. very busy usually, try to make a reservation beforehand!"
115,2,"The food was great. We had the spicy chicken stew and the spicy fried dumpling. However, the staff did not make me feel comfortable. The waiter assigned to our table only took our order and stayed away from our table for most of the evening. There was this one waitress with bleached blonde hair that kept staring at me as if she‚Äòs never seen a black person before. She was hovering around our table and no one else‚Äôs. She was very attentive to our table and wasn‚Äôt even our waitress. She wasn‚Äôt staring at my friend or anyone else at the restaurant, just me.... Towards the end, the waiter assigned to our table was gawking at me too. I was the only black person in the restaurant. As a person who has gone to plenty of Korean restaurant/spots, I‚Äôve never experienced this before. They cannot expect their restaurant to survive if they keep gawking at their POC patrons."
116,5,Yummy macguli and food. I brought my colleges they love all food we order. Especially macguli cocktail I love it!!!
117,5,"The drinks were great. I love the table buzzers, it makes me feel more comfortable when I need something to call the server over by ringing for them. The fist cake soup was delicious but the egg was the least tasty one I've ever had."
118,5,"Extremely friendly atmosphere even during peak hours, environment never changes, food is always consistent, drinks are always good, and music and decor are cute. I am glad I still anticipate coming here every time I visit ny! Introduced my coworkers from philly and they have said they also enjoyed the food, the music, drinks, but most of all, the friendly and tentative service"
119,5,"Food is fantastic and cool place. The waitor we had must be new. Nice guy though. He couldn't make any recommendations and told us the the portion size was small, which turned out to be the opposite. The army stew is so delicious! I will definitely go back."
120,4,"The vibe of the place is really outstanding. It gives you that ""underground bar"" kind of feeling because it literally is underground. Food was good, (little pricey), drinks were good. Only problem i had was that the service of the staff was a little slow, although they were really helpful when you ask. Can definitely go here with a small group or large group."
121,4,Great atmosphere mainly full of younger people. This place is very hard to spot since it is in the basement and the sign outside is not very visible. It is right next to duet and once you walk down the stairs you will see a bar. This place gets really packed during the evening so you may have to wait 30 minutes or so before getting to order at a table. The food is served in smaller portions so you may have to order 2 dishes in order to be satisfied.
122,4,"They have a great mixture of food selection, ranging from casseroles to grilled food to even some finger food like calamari and fries! The food portion to price is pretty good considering how yummy the food was. I especially enjoyed the clam casserole with a hint of a kick, which was popular for people who couldn't eat spicy food."
123,5,I would say it's a staple in K-Town. The food was amazing. The drinks hit the spot. Staff was friendly and attentive. What caught my attention was a minor detail. Every seat came with a blanket. Very cozy. I definitely recommend this spot. Cheers...
124,5,"When you know a good place you want to come back. My friends and I stop by Bangia tonight for couple drinks. I like to spoil my friend who doesn't want to go home yet, lol. We get a table at the bar area. I share a bottle of wine with my friend and another friend just has light beer."
125,5,"Delicious and filling food, I can never finish my plate! Beautiful atmosphere inside, alright outdoor sitting."
126,1,"Worst service I got so far. The waiter at the entrance checked my driver‚Äôs license and kept implying it was a fake ID, saying ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm from New Jersey too. This is not a Real ID.‚Äù After I insisted him to check again, he even bent my card to see if it‚Äôs real. This is really humiliating and maybe you should train your staff that NJ has more than one type of driver‚Äôs license? I hav never been to a Korean restaurant like this"
127,1,"I always liked this place, for food and service. Until.... They had added this fried chicken on the menu. It wasn't cooked fully, sent back once, came back with thigh / drumstick still not cooked through... Service is not that great either any more. We left both legs untouched, nobody asked if there was something wrong, especially after it had to go back to the kitchen once, you would think they would check. I won't be going back, another one bites the dust, sigh....."
128,5,First time diner. I am eating the most delicious kimchi pork mozzarella rice cake (noodle) dish of my LIFE. Also the seafood pancake. Super friendly staff.
129,4,You don't find Andong Chicken in many Korean restaurants.
130,4,"I visited with 3 other friends after trying to avoid the long wait at another restaurant down the street. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and was seated right away. The staff was friendly and cordial which is always a plus for me. The 3 of us shared one stew and one signature seafood cheese dukbokki (sticky rice cake) dish and it was plenty food. Not too many banchans here but we did each get a ginger salad as a complimentary appetizer and another banchan salad to share. Fun atmosphere, good food, and pleasant servers have me willing to go back."
131,5,This place is amazing! Their food is great and the service is wonderful. I love the underground bar vibe and the staff was willing to make suggestions and even give advice as to how the food should be eaten so it's not intimidating to those who aren't familiar with Korean food! Try the Army stew! You won't regret it!
132,3,The staff messed up bills and seatings(we said we wanted to move to a table but somebody came after us moved first). Food is okay. The chicken wings were not as good as I expected.
133,4,"The litchi alcohol drink (forgot the name) is the best. The food tastes good, and size is big enough (very big), price is also reasonable. But I would think twice to come here, because the table is just so tiny, that you could barely put everything on there. It would not be easy to reach for things you want(like dishes or water bottle), since you‚Äôll probably need to go over other dishes."
134,5,"The Spicy Rice Cake with Stir-Fried Pork, Kimchi, Mozzarella Cheese (Cheesy Tteokbokki) is a must. (Even better if you have the late night munchies post partying.). My friends Door Dashed it for $26. Apparently a lot of their items on the menu have cheese in it... So if you're in the mood for both pizza and Korean, give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."
135,5,They have the best seafood cheese spicy rice cake!
136,5,"I love Yejin, amazing service and helped us order the right drinks! Def try the lychee soju cocktail, comes with a big cup of lychees!"
137,1,"Horrible service - we were a large party, and they initially said it would take 40 minutes for a table so we thanked them and started to leave. However, shortly after the host told me that it would only be a 10 wait instead. We ended up waiting for a full hour, with them continually being dishonest about their availability and a wait time estimate. The drinks and food was fine, but did not make up at all for the wait. If you're a large party and are not looking to be lied at, go somewhere else."
138,5,"Army stew, seafood pancake, grain makgeolli cocktail are great."
139,2,"I‚Äôve been coming to Bangia for about 5 years, but these last two trips have left much to be desired. The service is much less friendly than it used to be, and somewhere over the last year the chef has changed. The dishes are the same, but are slightly different. The sauce on tteokbokki is bland and almost soupy compared to how it used to be prepared. The servers used to accommodate slight changes to the dishes but now just say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt do that‚Äù even though it‚Äôs been my go-to order for years. This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants and my go-to for introducing people to Korean food that isn‚Äôt BBQ. I leave this for feedback only, and hopeful that the Bangia I knew will come back!"
140,4,Great place to have a drink or two. A bit loud but understandable it's a packed place. Younger crowd so it might get a bit hectic. I love there French fries tho this time I visited I only had beer. the restroom was out of order so spent an hour but waited for the restroom for 30 mins lol
141,5,"I guess this is the second largest Korean style bar in Manhattan. great customer service even though they are usually super packed during the weekend. The food is okay, the price is not overpriced at all. Bangia (Ban Jiha) means half underground basement btw."
142,3,Good and flavorful food. The wait staff is not attentive. I would recommend it if you're looking for solid Korean food and don't care about customer service.
143,1,"A few friends and I came to Bangia right at opening on a Friday night and ordered the grilled pork belly, spicy pork belly & fried rice in stone pot, and the soy garlic wings. The food wasn't the best; the wings were dry and the fried rice was one of the saltiest things I've ever tasted. The service, as well, wasn't the best. We had to wait almost 10 minutes at the hostess stand (this was after opening time) before someone would come and seat us. Even after we were seated, we still had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to get water. We thought this was a bit strange considering we were the only party there at the time. However, the real problem occurred after we left the restaurant. I paid for the bill using my card and the total (after writing in tip) came out to $69 for three people. A few days later, upon logging into my banking app, I was shocked to see that Bangia had charged me $971.88 for the meal, $902.88 MORE than the $69 total that I had indicated on the receipt. I always make an effort to make the tip and total very clear when filling out the receipts: the ""cent"" numbers are always written smaller and underlined, so there should be no room for confusion, let alone room for an extra $902.88 charge. That evening we contacted the restaurant and spoke with the manager, who said that he knew that he had made a mistake, but was ""waiting for us to contact him"", before fixing his mistake and issuing a refund. What if I never noticed, and as a result, never contacted him? Was he planning on just keeping the extra $900, even if he KNEW that a mistake had occurred? Interestingly, a quick search (there's another review here on Yelp) shows that other customers ALSO had issues with being charged extra tip. Hmm. I don't recommend this restaurant at all-- there's no point in risking an extra $900 charge on your card to eat mediocre food and receive mediocre service. There are a ton of better options in Koreatown."
144,5,"Staff is really nice, and that AC is even nicer. The soju cocktails here are gooood. Wish outdoor dining was open when I visited with a friend. Will have to come back again."
145,5,"My co-workers wanted Korean fried chicken after work so we decided to check out this new spot after reading some recent Yelp reviews. It didn't seem to look like a restaurant when I first walked in. I saw a full bar but realized after that they served food and had tables in the back. I ordered the fried chicken and cold draft beers. Now I've had tons of fried chicken before in this neighborhood from Kyochon, Bonchon, WA Bar and even Mad For Chicken, but Bangia brings originality with their chicken without being too greasy, very crispy, crunchy and It's not overly flavored which bring out the natural flavors of the chicken. The fried chicken was super light and the beers were ice cold. Service was on point but then again they had those buttons at the table which you can abuse for service. If you want a chicken and beer night, check out this new spot!"
146,2,We came here on a Wednesday night so the place wasn't busy. Despite that we received bad service. We didn't get water until we asked for it and once we ordered a bottle or alcohol we weren't given any cups for it either until we asked. We got the budaejigae and a spicy pork dish which weren't very good or authentic in my opinion.
147,5,"Great Korean bar with small selection of delicious food. Love their Yuzu Makgeolli (light alcohol citrus drink) and seafood pancake. Portions r huge so get things to share. I just wish more items were not spicy, as I can't tolerate their spicy options."
148,5,"Great cocktails! I like sweeter cocktails and the lychee martini and lychee soju were right up my alley! The happy hour deals are really great, highly recommend! The food was good too of course :)"
149,5,Good spot for late night food. Not your typical Korean food and most main course are easily large enough to feed the two (I had the kimchi stew and it's way more than what one person can have).
150,5,"Great playlist, amazing happy hour, and always a good time. Tends to get crowded quickly on weekends, but that's to be expected of k-town these days. Try the cheese/seafood tteokbokki and the jokbal. Portions are very generous and cocktails are very strong."
151,5,Superb Korean food. Especially the pork feet
152,5,"My only issue is that we had a little misunderstanding with our waiter tonight because we forgot to tip him. It was my mistake because I didn‚Äôt read the receipt very well. I thought the gratuity would be included in my bill. I was shocked to see him follow us outside to ask us why we didn‚Äôt tip him, even though he wasn‚Äôt rude when asking I thought that was a bit unusual. Anyways I went back in the restaurant to tip him but it looked like it still wasn‚Äôt enough apparently, my mistake again I‚Äôm not from the USA so I don‚Äôt know about the whole tipping issue. Lesson learned. I just wish this misunderstanding didn‚Äôt happen. Other than that he was a really nice guy. Sorry again tho."
153,2,"I came here for dinner on a Tuesday with three friends. The service was terribly slow. We ordered the army's stew, the half/half chicken wings and fries. It took forever for the stew to come out. We asked for rice that never came out. We also asked for more ramen and that also never came out. We asked for extra seasoning for the stew and again, never came out. Servers barely stopped by either to check up on us."
154,4,"Needed a reservation both times I ate there but worth the foresight. This is top three most authentic Korean place in the Ktown area, in my opinion. The portions are big, beer is cold and kpop on point with lots of TV screens."
155,5,"I checked out this restaurant after a friend of mine praised about the original Korean fried chicken and the bbq pork intestines (not many places have this) which is a really popular late night Korean dish when you're drinking. Basically, I was pleasantly surprised to find some clean flavored dishes. The place has a great drinking atmosphere and the service was friendly. My favorites were the Original Fried Chicken (Not the flavored), The JOK Bal (pork feet) and the Intestines where you dip it in the pickled onion sauce! Def. can't wait to check out the other dishes next time."
156,3,"Was excited about their jok bal, but was a little disappointed because there were more jelly fish than the meat. The wings were to saucy. The only thing that I enjoyed was the yuzu soju cocktail. Service was very friendly. Nice atmosphere."
157,4,"Decent place, can be quite pricey. Big portions but service can be subpar. They take your order quite quickly, drinks take quite awhile to get to the table and paying the check shouldn't take 10-15 mins to arrive. Dined the other day on a weekday and quite a few patrons were complaining about being able to jusy pay and leave"
158,4,"Nice place really crowded, you need an ID and be aware of the loudness because my head was banging for an entire day. It‚Äôs pricy and usually has people of particular ethnicity dominating the place. English music so anyone can understand. Go on the weekend for more fun!"
159,5,"This place isn't your usual Korean restaurant with the usual Korean bbq and soups and stews, and that's the best part. They have more of what would be considered Korean street food or hangout food rather than the traditional stuff, and it's such a great change of pace. And the decor adds to the street feel. My friend and I shared bossam and andong chicken, both of which were really good. The portions are pretty large, so go hungry. But don't expect rice; it doesn't come as part of the meal. If you're low carbing and like meat, I would definitely recommend bossam. The andong chicken is good also, but it does come with noodles, dduk (aka rice cakes) and potatoes. I am definitely going back to try other stuff on the menu."
160,2,"I have been there over 5 times - the quality and taste of food decreases each time. The army stew we had yesterday was blend, with very few sausages and several pieces of bacon stuck together. Very disappointedüò• ‚Ä¶"
161,1,"My friend and I attempted to stop in for a few drinks. We put our name in with the host and explicitly said that we were only planning on drinking and only needed a spot at the bar. The host said it would be 20-30 minutes, which we were ok with as it was clearly busy. After 35 minutes or so, two spots opened at the bar. We noticed that we were next on the list to be seated at these seats and that the bartender was clearing/cleaning them for us. They cleared the spots then in walked a couple that clearly knew the host (they did not have their name on the list). Rather than respecting our name on the list/the time we spent waiting, the host sat the couple that just walked in. When I attempted to ask why- the host only shrugged and apologized. We left and found better options for the soju we were looking for at other bars in the area that respected our time and had a better grasp of customer service. Recommend going elsewhere if theyre too busy to seat you- save your time for a place that will serve you/respect your wait time. EDIT: as requested by the owner in their response. I arrived approximately 8:26 PM (sent a confirmation text to my friend) and left at 8:54 PM (sent a text to a different group that we could meet up earlier than expected). The issue was not the wait time- it was a Friday night, we expected a wait. The issue was that there was only a party of 4 ahead of us on the list at the time, and they were hoping to get a table to eat. 2 spots opened at the bar, we had been waiting the longest (other than the party of 4) and yet the bar spots were given to two people that walked in when we were told they were being cleared for us."
162,2,I only came here because I was gonna go to gopchang story bbq but they gave me a wait time of 1 hour!!! My partner didn't want to wait because they said 1 hour. So I came to bangia! Will not return back! Ordered al tang and it was just very disappointing! The soup tasted more like bean paste stew then spicy cod egg stew! In the menu it says spicy! But this stew wasn't spicy along with it has fishy smell on the roe from there I couldn't eat it anymore! I'm very picky and very sensitive with the taste. Someone review this place about their soup so it made rethink about getting the soup here but there was nothing else to eat so I had no choice. You get 10% off only if you pay in CASH!! I guess a lot of people pay with credit card and probably they are in need of cash (lol)
163,5,Good food and service. The music is a bit loud though.
164,5,Love it. Tuesday cocktail $9.99
165,3,"Make sure you put ur name down first when u go in. Went there Thursday night and waited abt an hr. Everything just tasted alright, whole fried chicken is super dry =/ Cocktail drink tasted good though."
166,5,"Open super late. Amazing cocktails, basically hidden. Like a Korean speakeasy. Try the army stew! It's like pizza soup. Best drunk food."
167,5,"Neat little dive off Fifth Ave! Lots of menu variety, and delicious food. Didn't have time for drinks, but the cocktail menu looks great! Will definitely be back!"
168,3,Maybe they were understaffed on the night I visited but I wished the service could‚Äôve been better.
169,3,Nice place. Good Soju cocktails. Had lychee soju cocktail. Snacks / food is average - had kimchi pork pancake and spicy pigs feet. Staff and servers are friendly and courteous. The place is on the expensive side.
170,1,I spent my two days in bed. Who else agree with me.... that your stomach suffer for 2 days after eating at bangia ? All I got were 1. Cheese chicken 2. Seafood soup 2. Two bottle soju
171,5,We stumbled into this place without knowing anything beforehand and were absolutely floored by the quality of the food and the service! Try a Bing Mac!
172,4,"An underground bubbling mecca of monumental flavors, now temporarily forced to surface with to-go safe delivery. The steamed fried chicken and wings are an salivating escape. Your mouth will thank you for the deserving price."
173,5,Excellent place to get a good Korean food
174,5,"Great food, great vibes. Favorite Korean restaurant in Ktown but can be super busy. Regarding drinks, the fruit punch is sooo tasty"
175,5,"WOAH. One of my favorite restaurants in K-Town. SO, the way the name is spelled out in English makes the restaurant sound like, ""Is it a ring?"" HAHA but correct me if I'm wrong, it actually means half basement in Korean. The vibe here is chill and I love the giraffe in the basement. I always end up petting it when I've taken in a few bottles of Chamisul. (soju) Food is even better here than most K-Town spots. This is my favorite spot for Budaejigae (army stew) and Seafood Cheese Dukboki (rice cakes). For the dukboki they add on top plenty of cheese and mix in seafood such as mussels and octopus. But better than the ingredients they cook the rice cakes so it's SOFT and not too chewy like other places I've tried. Also give their fried chicken a try! Their radish is a tad spicy compared to other places. Weekdays are pretty empty but weekends here are always packed with a thirty to forty-five minute wait."
176,4,"It's a cute little place in the basement that has the oddest collection of decor. The only way I can describe it is that someone was on Pinterest and decoratwd based off all the different things that are trending. But I love it. The food is really good. I think the protions are meant for sharing but I'm not sure. I keep ordering the same dish, the army stew. It's a stew that has sliced hotdogs, salami, ramen and rice cakes in a spicy broth with melted cheese on top."
177,5,I should've finish the plate.
178,4,"A little on the expensive side, but pretty good Korean comfort food. I finally had Budae Jigae (Military stew) for the first time. It's a nice cozy dive atmosphere though."
179,3,Food was ok but service was really rushed. Was there for less than an hour after ordering multiple drinks and they gave us the check before asking if we wanted to order anything else.
180,5,"Food was amazingly delicious, portions are satisfying. Waiter was quick to response and price was just right. Very good Korean food thank you."
181,4,"Great atmosphere but I've definitely had better kimchi pancakes. That said I hardly feel that's the right dish to judge the place on, and you cannot argue with the prices."
182,4,A great atmosphere and good music. Wait time is quite long but that‚Äôs not their fault. The food was good as well.
183,1,"9/21/19 Saturday, one of my friend forget to bring her ID the security guy won‚Äôt let us in the restaurant so we decide to find another spot instead, right before we head out the security guy said, unless you pay me some money! I told him it‚Äôs illegal to do so, he even said he just doing he‚Äôs job in the right way and feel free to talk the manager of the restaurant will receive same result. I don‚Äôt understand which part of doing the job in right way when you asking for money to get in a restaurant? Ridiculous!"
184,5,Such great food!! They offer Korean comfort food and it was definitely filling. It's good that this place is off the beaten path as it would be a shame to have this place turned into a tourist trap.
185,5,Went there on a Sunday night after 10pm‚Äîthis was basically the only place in K-Town that was still open. Food was pretty good. Hope to try their drinks in another visit.
186,4,"Came here on a Thursday night after a long night of happy hour drinking and decided to grab some Korean ""pocha"" style food. Usually I would check out the K-town block on 32nd street but lately I've decided to venture other spots which are located outside the infamous K-town block. Bangia is a new hotspot and buzzing after a bunch of my foodie Korean friends went there for a tasting. Long story short, It's dark and the atmosphere has a very ""drinking"" environment. We ordered the budae jjigae (military stew) and an endless amount of soju which made it tough next morning, but it was all worth it. The food was delicious and the drinks kept coming."
187,5,My first time going here for my birthday and I'm glad I chose this place. The wait for a table wasn't very long and the food was soooooo good. Planning to go again soon.
188,1,"They mixed the soju with water. I can't believe it. Was using the bathroom and saw how they mixed the ""soju"" cocktails. DO NOT GO HERE!!"
189,5,Underground bar with K-Pop classics. Great menu selection of food a soju. Left buzzed and full at 7pm.
190,5,Food was delicious. Their pork feet is soft and juicy. Pork belly was very tender.

310,5,Like the budaejjigae!

312,2,Garbage service.
313,4,"There were quite a few handsome guys inside the store, but they just asked for ID as soon as they entered, and when they were about to get the ID, the store clerk ran away... He didn't even look at it... Maybe they didn't drink when they saw me and my friend, so it didn't matter. The pig's trotters are quite delicious. Others may not like the taste very much. The price is also on the expensive side."
314,5,I was able to wash away the sweetness and greasiness that could not be alleviated even when eating Korean food in the United States. I really liked the real Korean Pocha feel.
315,3,"The service is the same as in Korea. Can you speak Korean in New York? Do you have a familiar water bottle? I ordered budae hotpot, but couldn't find the ham. I tried it with tofu and ramen. Google Map users who want to drink soju in New York may want to check it out. Good luck with your trip to New York, everyone!"
316,5,This is a great kimchi stew restaurant... Be sure to try the tuna kimchi stew.
317,5,The service is very good and the snacks are varied. I think it‚Äôs so good to drink!!!

320,5,"Great restaurant! Lychee Soju will serve you with a bowl of lychees! So delicious! Spicy pork feet are particularly fragrant! The service is very good! At that time, our cup slipped and the military pot splashed on our clothes. As a result, the store clerk gave us a free order! Oh My God"
321,1,"After visiting the store, I found out that I lost my card, so I called the store the same day and asked them to check whether my card was there or not. They said that they couldn't check it over the phone because there were a lot of lost cards, and that they would only check it if I brought my ID in person. No, I don't even know if the card is there or not, so I have to go there in person to ""check"" whether the card is there or not. I understand that the employees there are busy, but I don't understand why they say it takes a few minutes to check for a lost card on the same day."
322,5,The staff are also very friendly and nice.
323,5,"It was so good. I went there with my kids, but I was embarrassed because it was a pub. I gained peace of mind in New York by accommodating my children. ^^ Good space, good people, things will get better~~"
324,3,"The location is good and the food is so-so. It has the atmosphere of a Korean pub, but the ingredients and composition of the food are disappointing in many ways."
325,5,"Honestly, any Korean would know that it tastes better than the real Korea. Especially Budaejjigae Tteokbokki...a work of art. It's Korean food in New York, and if you order soju here, it's a place where a miracle happens that will give you an appetite you never knew before."
326,4,"A place with alcohol, various snacks, service, dalgaljjim, and friendly and sensible staff."
327,5,"I went there after seeing a review saying it was better than Korea, but it was soggy..."
328,5,Big and good dishes. Very friendly service
